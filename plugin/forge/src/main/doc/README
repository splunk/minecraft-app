Splunk logger for Minecraft Forge 0.1 Alpha

The Splunk logger for Minecraft Forge provides additional logging
functionality to the Minecraft Forge server. The logs are written
to the console and the Minecraft server log, and to any number of Splunk
TCP input ports declared in config.yml.

The messages conform to Splunk's logging best practices:

INSTALLATION

**SPECIFY CONFIG DIRECTORY HERE*** In that directory write a config.yml
file specifying what Splunk TCP ports to log to, e.g.,

splunks: localhost:10000, mc.splunk.local:10000, pq.5f.as.23:111

Then start your Forge server or, if it is already running, run the command
'reload' in the server console *** DOES FORGE HAVE RELOAD?***.
