Splunk logger for Minecraft Forge 1.0-SNAPSHOT

To install, add the LogToSplunkPlugin build by this project
to your plugins directory for Spigot and the mod directory for
Forge (see respective docs in Spigot/Forge for more info).

The Splunk logger for Minecraft Forge provides additional logging
functionality to the Minecraft Forge server. The logs are written
to the console/Minecraft server log and to the http collector at
a given Splunk host:port. A splunk token must be generated for the
collector and assigned to the property `splunk.craft.token`.

The config file should be located here: `config/splunk.properties`
where that path is relative to the directory minecraft is run from.

The messages conform to Splunk's logging best practices:
